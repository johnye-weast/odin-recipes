        <h2>But What Is It></h2>
        <p>
            Black beans are a relic of the bean lords that were left over from the bygone days of old. Many people
            <br>used to walk around with beans in their pocket to show to others who might be curious about them. If
            <br>you had a bean blacker thant the other person's, you were known as the bean buster and were able to
            <br>take the other person's bean home, cook it, and give it to your pet pauper.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another thing that most people don't know about beans is that they are actually really good to eat. Joke's
            <br>on all the fuedal overlords. Turns out they're delicious. We're going to make them as good as possible.
