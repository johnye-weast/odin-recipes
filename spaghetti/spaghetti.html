        <h2>But What Is It?</h2>
        <p>
            Spaghetti soup is a staple of the Italian Mafia and was created to put into giant pots so
            <br>that they could smuggle tommy guns into movie theatres and dinners with important people.
            <br>In doing so they became the world's greatest (and fattest) criminals!
        </p>

        <p>
            Another good use for this today is to hand out to kids who seem like they might want to join
            <br>the mafia as well. It is well known that this is why many kids in New York opt for their
            <br>big ol bowls. They have all kinds of tommy guns to tote around and it would be a shame
            <br>to get caught.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Spaghetti Noodles</li>
            <li>Marianas Trench Sauce</li>
            <li>1 Tomato</li>
            <li>1 Handful of Goat Meat</li>
            <li>2 Tommy Guns</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Throw the noodles all over the ground, unless you like noodles, in which case you should
            <br>probably just put them in some boiling water with all of the other enemies of the mafia.</li>
            <li>Put your tomato into the marianas trench sauce. It's imperative that this sauce be fresh
            <br>from the Marianas other wise it will probably just taste like grosser spaghetti.</li>
            <li>Once the noodles are done boiling, throw in the marianas trench sauce and say something
            <br>along the lines of "Look here, seeee!"</li>
            <li>Sprinkle your two tommy guns on top and take it to the shebang!</li>
        </ol>
