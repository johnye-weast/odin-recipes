        <h2>But What Is It?</h2>
        
        <p>
            This chicken is pretty dank, no cap. In fact, you won't even want the cap once you've taken it
            <br>off because you will finish it in one sitting. I had my doubts that this would be the
            <br>banger that I had heard so much about but after slaving in the kitchen all night after the
            <br>gym, I knew that I was going to be jacked.
        </p>

        <p>
            First of all, I really enjoy taking the powers of protes away from chicken. It really gets me
            <br>absolutely stoked knowing that I'm going to be like nine times the size of that chicken 
            <br>after I get done with that meal. A little eatin' a little sleepin' and I am indestructable.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Gotta have the chicken</li>
            <li>2 flakes of pepper</li>
            <li>Da juice</li>
            <li>A shirt</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Lay the chicken out. When I say that I mean...punch the chicken in the face. Those are your
            <br>gains now.</li>
            <li>Defeather the chicken and throw the body into the four flakes of pepper. You really don't
            <br>want too many calories in this meal so don't use more than 5.</li>
            <li>Finally, pressure cook the chicken between your pecs for three seconds. Make sure to leave
            <br>off the sleeves for this. We need all the heat we can get.</li>
        </ol>
